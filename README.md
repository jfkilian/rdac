# RDAC to WAV Decoding

A collection of C and Go code to decode Roland's old RDAC audio encoding format used in their VS line of recorders. 

This is an initial upload of the code I have found on my old systems. I developed it on and off over the last 16 years. It could probably use a bit more organization :)

All the important bits for decoding RDAC and unscrambling the custom FAT file format are here.

Enjoy!

In the LIV_mode branch this fork contains a prototype for decoding also file recorded with Roland's LIV mode settings. It basically works, but the decoding patterns need to be reverse engineered.
I stopped further research since there is an official tool available:

This software can also devoce VS-880 LIV / Live mode encoded files.
